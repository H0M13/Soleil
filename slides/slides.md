DAI submitted to smart contract and distribution schedule set by user.

<div style="display: flex;">
<img src="1.png" style="background:transparent; border:none;  box-shadow: none; height: 400px" />

<span class="fragment">

> "I would like to donate 200 DAI to solar panel owners gradually over the next 30 days."

</span>
</div>

--

DAI scheduled to be distributed that day becomes claimable by sites based on the amount of solar energy generated by them on that day.

As a reward for helping to fight climate change users are rewarded with SLL tokens.

--

An economy can be grown around the SLL token by anyone who wishes to fight climate change by supporting the growth of the Soleil platform.

Because sites are incentivised to provide their data, we can collate data over a range of providers to build up a large data feed.

Far too much data to feasibly store on-chain.

<div style="background-color: white; color: black; padding: 20px">

<img src="chainlink.png" style="background:transparent; border:none; box-shadow: none; height: 100px" />
<img src="ceramic.png" style="background:transparent; border:none; box-shadow: none; height: 100px" />

Ceramic provides a way for us to store a decentralised data stream on top of IPFS which can act as an off-chain data feed.
</div>


---

Unlike using IPFS directly, using a Ceramic data stream allows us to point to mutable data with a single address. Streams are built up from of a series of immutable commits.

Soleil uses Chainlink nodes to store three data feeds as streams on Ceramic:

- Energy generated per site
- Cumulative DAI earnings per site
- Cumulative SLL rewards per user

---

## Gas efficient payments

---

Submitting transactions to reward every user with DAI and SLL would use a lot of gas and not allow the platform to scale.

=> Look to a 'cumulative merkle drop' solution

---

<img src="merkle-tree.png" style="background:#fff; border:none; box-shadow: none; height: 250px" />

Merkle trees are used to facilitate payments of DAI and SLL.

Two custom Chainlink external adapters calculate the merkle root of the cumulative earnings/rewards feeds and submit them to Soleil pool manager contract.

---

<img src="claim-form.png" style="background:#fff; border:none; box-shadow: none; height: 250px" />

Soleil web app looks at our Ceramic data streams to notify the user of how many claimable tokens are available to them.

Also allows them to easily generate a merkle proof against the latest merkle root to submit to the Pool Manager contract to claim their tokens.
